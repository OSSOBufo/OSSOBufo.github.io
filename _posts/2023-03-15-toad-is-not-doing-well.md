<p style="font-size:18px;">There are disturbing reports from neighboring countries (the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Switzerland) of drastic declines in the numbers of toads per population. Something also seems to be going on in Flanders, with mainly anecdotal reports of greatly reduced numbers of toads recorded during the spring migration. It is not known how big the problem is and what the possible causes are. Thanks to the toad patrols that Natuurpunt and HYLA have been organizing with the help of volunteers since 1981, a wealth of data is available to map this problem. Researchers from Ghent University, together with Natuurpunt, want to map the severity of the supposed decline and investigate the cause (or causes) of the decline in order to formulate advice in the hope of turning the tide.</p>
