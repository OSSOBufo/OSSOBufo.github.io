During this assignment 'Registration of fauna victims in traffic - “Animals under wheels 3.0” data was collected on roadkills in the Flemish region, in particular of the species groups 'amphibians and reptiles', 'birds' and 'mammals'.
<br/>
<br/>
An active promotion of road casualty monitoring clearly influences the collected number of observations, and is vital for a citizen science project with volunteers. That is why extensive attention was paid during this assignment to communication with volunteers, the general public and policy. Through various channels, everyone in Flanders was called on to help collect data, and the most important findings and results of this project were communicated.
<br/>
<br/>
During the period March 1, 2017 to Oktober 30, 2020, 2634 different observers collected a total of 30 873 observations of roadkills in Flanders, with a total of 37 319 individuals of 399 different species. The sad top 3 of most reported roadkills consists of the hedgehog (4707 sightings), the common toad (2953) and the wood pigeon (1988).
