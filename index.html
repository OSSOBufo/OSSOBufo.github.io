            <p class="lead">Human influences on nature are the most important factor behind the current decline in 
                biodiversity, forming the foundation of the ongoing sixth mass extinction event. It also includes 
                the decline of widespread and thus common species. Small proportional reductions in populations of 
                (to date) common species already have a large impact on ecosystem functioning and biomass.</p>
            <p class="lead">Amphibians are more threatened than many other animals in the sixth mass extinction. 
                The European common toad (<i>Bufo bufo</i>) occupies a variety of habitats. While its situation 
                was still assessed as stable in 2008 by IUCN, the species has undergone recent, widespread declines in abundance. 
                Multiple European countries (UK, Italy, Switzerland and the Netherlands) reported drastic declines in 
                population sizes of 50% or more.</p>

            <p class="lead">Understanding the causes of toad decline is key in designing measures to avert further biodiversity loss. 
                Such enigmatic declines are probably driven by a complex interplay between multiple stressors: land use 
                (e.g., agricultural cultivation practices, pesticide use), habitat (e.g., loss of ponds and small landscape elements) 
                and connectivity loss (including migratory connectivity between breeding ponds and terrestrial habitats), 
                climate change, loss of genetic diversity and disease.</p>
            <p class="lead">To initiate the investigation into the causes behind toad declines, it is necessary to conduct a 
                comprehensive analysis of the population trends. Sufficiently long time series are needed to estimate 
                the long-term trends in population size and to assess whether the populations are decreasing, increasing 
                or stable. During spring, toads undertake a widespread migration, which has been recorded by the v.z.w.

                <h4> <b>Natuurpunt Lennik participates in toad research at Ghent University: "Looking for the cause of the declining number of toads"</b> </h4>
                <p style="font-size: large;">Natuurpunt Lennik will once again help toads and amphibians safely cross the road in the coming weeks. In recent years, 
                    volunteers have seen the number of toads decline. "In 2018, our team of volunteers transferred about 1,400 toads, last year there were 971," says Marijke Wouters, 
                    coordinator of the toad transfer in Lennik. "We see a clear decline, but we cannot explain why."

                    A question that also fascinates several doctoral students from the Faculty of veterinary medicine of Ghent University. 
                    Together with the toad transferers in Lennik, among others, they will look for an answer. "How big is the problem and what are the possible causes of the toads'
                     decline?" </p>
